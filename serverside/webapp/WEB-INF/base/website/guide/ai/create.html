<p>It will open the prompt generator window. We made it easy and intuitive for you to provide basic information about what kind of image you'd like to create, and based on that, we generate a prompt for you.</p>

    </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>AI Prompt</strong>

<p>Once you fill in the form, click
  <strong>Create</strong>. It will start the generation process right away. This may take up to several minutes. You can close the window and continue with other tasks. Once the AI has finished generating the image, you will see it in the
  <strong>Files</strong>&nbsp;tab.</p>
